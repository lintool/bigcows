<h1>Big Cows 🐮</h1>

<p>by <a href="https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~jimmylin/">Jimmy Lin</a> (University of Waterloo)</p>

<p>Obviously, research contributions cannot be entirely quantified via
bibliometric statistics, which are known to be flawed in many ways
(including systematic biases). On the other hand, they do serve
as <i>one</i> (of many) signals, however noisy. Here, I provide that
signal.<p>

<h2>Faculty Lists</h2>

<p>These are lists of computer science faculty with profiles in
DBLP. For alignment, I use the same definitions (areas and
conferences) as <a href="http://csrankings.org/">CSRankings</a>. Due
to different data processing scripts (from the source, DBLP),
correspondence between the people that appear in CSRankings and these
lists is only approximate. However, the information provided is
complementary, as the focus of CSRankings is on <i>institutions</i>,
whereas I focus on <i>individuals</i> here. These lists can be
reasonably interpreted as, "I am interested in <i>X</i>, these are
potential faculty who might be good advisors". Of course, the lists
are not exhaustive, and there may be various reasons why a suitable
advisor might not be on these lists.</p>

<h2><i>Ad hoc</i> Lists</h2>

<p>These lists are compiled by me in a <i>ad hoc</i> manner, best
characterized as snowball sampling (i.e., if I come across a name, I
add to the list). I use a fairly simple test for inclusion: self
identification. That is, if a researcher uses a particular keyword (or
any reasonable variant) on their profile, they get included in the
discipline-specific lists. I'm always looking to expand the lists and
welcome additional contributions!<p>

<h2>What the hell is a big cow?</h2>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In an academic context, 大牛 🐮 (Dà niú), literally &quot;big cow&quot;, refers to a famous professor. It is quite linguistically productive, e.g., &quot;多牛?&quot; (lit. &quot;how cow(-ish)?&quot;), translation: &quot;how famous (is your professor)?&quot;</p>&mdash; Jimmy Lin (@lintool) <a href="https://twitter.com/lintool/status/1349447611388989441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>Yes, I know, <a href="https://github.com/lintool/bigcows/issues/4">the earliest year of publication is often wrong.</p>
